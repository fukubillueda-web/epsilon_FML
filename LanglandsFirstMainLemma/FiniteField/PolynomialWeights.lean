# Multiplicative weights on monic polynomials

The two Euler-product arguments in the manuscript use the coefficient convention

`P = X ^ r + a₁ X ^ (r - 1) + a₂ X ^ (r - 2) + ⋯`.

Mathlib's `Polynomial.nextCoeff` is `a₁`.  We define `secondCoeff P` as coefficient two of
`P.reverse`; this is `a₂` when `2 ≤ r` and is zero in degrees zero and one.  Polynomial
reversal then turns both product identities into the ordinary formulas for coefficients zero,
one, and two of a product.
